# HotSpotWatcher-Arduino  
**HotSpotWatcher-Arduino** is a simple and efficient project designed to monitor and alert about overheating in confined spaces, such as cabinets where electronic devices like gaming consoles are installed.  

Using an **Arduino**, temperature sensors, and basic components, the system provides real-time temperature monitoring, lighting up an LED and triggering sound alerts when predefined temperature thresholds are reached.

## üî• Problem Addressed  
Gaming consoles and other devices are often placed in cabinets or poorly ventilated spaces, which can lead to overheating. This may impact performance or even damage the equipment. **HotSpotWatcher-Arduino** helps prevent this by alerting you about critical temperatures, enabling proactive action.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
1. **Temperature Monitoring**:  
   - Detects and displays real-time ambient temperature.  

2. **Visual and Sound Alerts**:  
   - **`TEMP_WARNING` or higher**: Red LED is activated as an initial warning.  
   - **`TEMP_CRITICAL` or higher**: A buzzer starts beeping, signaling immediate action is needed.  
   - Configurable for progressive alerts as the temperature rises.
